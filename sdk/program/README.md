# Miraland Program

Use the Miraland Program Crate to write on-chain programs in Rust.  If writing client-side applications, use the [Miraland SDK Crate](https://crates.io/crates/miraland-sdk) instead.

More information about Miraland is available in the [Miraland documentation](https://docs.solana.com/).

[Miraland Program Library](https://github.com/solana-labs/solarti-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.

# Miraland SDK

Use the Miraland SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [Miraland Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/miraland-program) instead.

More information about Miraland is available in the [Miraland documentation](https://docs.solana.com/).

The [Miraland Program Library](https://github.com/solana-labs/solarti-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
